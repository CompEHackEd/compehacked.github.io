								<li>
									<p class="question">What happens at a hackathon?</p>
									<p class="answer">For 24 hours, participants work together in teams of 1 to 5 people to build a project. Teams can work on hardware or software projects. There is no limit on creativity. This hackathon acts as a sort of incubator to your mini projects as it provides a focused time to work on your idea with mentors and workshops to help you along.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p class="question">Do I need to know programming?</p>
									<p class="answer">Not at all! The hackathon’s purpose is to create a welcoming and supportive environment to learn. That works for any experience level, and any type of learning. The hackathon has plenty of mentors and resources to help you work on your hack. It’s the best place to try something new.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p class="question">Who organizes HackEDbeta?</p>
									<p class="answer">HackEDbeta is an event by the Computer Engineering Club of the University of Alberta! This will be the second time running this event and the sixth hackathon organized overall.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p class="question">Is this a competition? Do I have to compete and present my work?</p>
									<p class="answer">Our hackathon has a competition portion where you will present your work at the end, but this is NOT mandatory. If you do not feel comfortable entering the competition with your work, no worries! At the event you can opt out before presentations begin on Sunday. The most important part of this hackathon is that you come out of it having tried something new.</p>

									<p class="question">Do I have to be in Computer Engineering/Computer Science to participate in this hackathon?</p>

								</li>
								<li>
									<p class="question">How’s the wifi situation?</p>
									<p class="answer">Pretty good, but it can get laggy! If you have ideas on what you wish to create already, and know what tools you need, we recommend downloading them at home the night before. This will help you kickstart your project and help to keep the WiFi fast!</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p class="question">Where is it located? Will there be parking available?</p>
									<p class="answer">HackEDbeta will take place at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/mbrbqXVtKPF2">Startup Edmonton (301, 10359 104 St Mercer Warehouse)</a>. The closest LRT station is MacEwan station, only a 2 minute walk away. There are parking lots within walking distance, but these lots are paid.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p class="question">What should I bring?</p>
									<p class="answer">Make sure to bring your laptop, charger and any other required tech you’ll need for your hack. You will find it helpful to bring along key items you would bring to a sleepover: pillows, blanket, toothbrush/toothpaste, deodorant, earphones, etc.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p class="question">What shouldn’t I bring?</p>

									<p class="question">I don’t have a team…</p>
									<p class="answer">There will be opportunities for willing participants to look for, make or join a team before and at the hackathon through the Slack and after opening ceremonies.

								</li>
								<li>
									<p class="question">Any available resources?</p>
									<p class="answer">Hardware resources are not provided to hackers at HackEDbeta, but APIs and software are! Feel free to bring your own hardware resources such as monitors, Arduino boards, etc. We hope you can get all the tools necessary to complete your hack!</p>
