				<div class="section-title">BRING IT</div>
				<p>Hackathons are for designing, creating, and building awesome projects. HackED is the premiere annual 24-hour hackathon from the Computer Engineering Club of the University of Alberta.</p>
				<div class="small-title accent"><div class="accent-on-white">Apply Yourself</div></div>
				<p>This event is for hackers who choose to learn because they can, and build because they love it. Bring your creativity and create solutions to the problems that you deem important and that you want to work towards. Bring your team (up to five) and work together to overcome challenges, whether that’s in software, hardware, design or strategy. HackED is about working together and applying yourself, your skills and your creativity.</p>
				<div class="small-title accent"><div class="accent-on-white">We Got You</div></div>
                <p>To help your journey, we take care of the details. HackED 2018 features more food, more space, more prizes and more swag. We provide you with three meals and a ton of snacks to power you through your hack. We’re expanding into the eighth floor of Donadeo ICE to give your team more room to think and collaborate. We’re spending over $1k on prizes, split between winning at the end, trivia throughout the night and some surprises too. And this year, we’re releasing custom HackED T-shirts for the first time in HackED history.</p>
                <div class="small-title accent"><div class="accent-on-white">Our Friends</div></div>
				<p>HackED 2018 also welcomes back our friends MLH from last year. Follow their <a href="https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf" target="_blank">Code of Conduct</a> and enjoy their A-list stickers, free AWS credits, free APIs, free domains and especially the free hardware from their <a href="https://sponsor.mlh.io/directory/#hardware-lab" target="_blank">Hardware Lab</a>. Our friends from StartUp Edmonton are still here as well. Meet members of the community at the event that help us by volunteering and mentoring, make use of their <a href="http://www.startupedmonton.com/students/" target="_blank">student resources</a> after the hackathon too. If you’d like to join us as a volunteer or mentor reach out to us at <a href="mailto:hacked.compeclub.com" target="_blank">hacked.compeclub.com</a>. We’d be happy to bring you on to the team. </p>
                <div class="small-title accent"><div class="accent-on-white">Bring it</div></div>
                <p>Join us over the weekend of January 27 to hack your way to something new, whether you’re learning to code for the first time or flexing your hacking muscle trying to build the next big thing. Bring on the challenge, bring your ideas to life. </p>

									<p class="question">What happens at a hackathon?</p>
									<p class="answer">For 24 hours, participants work together in teams of 1 to 5 people to build a project. Teams can work on hardware or software projects. There is no limit on creativity.

								</li>
								<li>
									<p class="question">Do I need to know programming?</p>
									<p class="answer">Not at all! The hackathon’s purpose is to create a welcoming and supportive environment to learn. That works for any experience level, and any type of learning. The hackathon has plenty of mentors and resources to help you work on your hack. It’s the best place to try something new.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
